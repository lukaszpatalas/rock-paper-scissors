# rock-paper-scissors
Project based on assignment from The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors.

I will use SCSS in a bid to learn about it by practising. Main motivation
to start using it are scss variables, which will help me swap more easily 
between colours when deciding about colour layout.

I will also take the opportunity to learn about using and styling 
fontawesome icons, as I will be using them for the first time.
